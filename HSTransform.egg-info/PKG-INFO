# Hyperbolic S-Transform

Package for Hyperbolic S-transform

## 1. Introduction

HS Transform is a Python package for performing Hyperbolic [S-transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_transform) [[1]](#1). The S-transform is a time-frequency representation that combines the best properties of the Short-time Fourier Transform and the Wavelet Transform. It provides simultaneous information on both the frequency content and temporal localization of a signal.

This is a work of my [published paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8423487)

## 2. Dependencies

HS Transform requires the following Python packages:

- numpy
- scipy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- pytest

## 3. How to Install

After that, you can install HS Transform using pip:

```
pip install HSTransform
```

You can also install all dependencies and package in 1 statement

```
pip install numpy scipy pandas matplotlib pytest HSTransform
```

## 4. Run tests

After installation, you can test the package using the included test scripts:
`pytest tests/`

## 5. Example

Here’s an example of how to use HS Transform to analyze a signal with voltage disturbance and power system fault:

It's noted sometimes you need to include the installed HSTransform package location into sys

```python
import sys
import os

# Add the package directory to sys.path
package_path = os.path.abspath('/usr/local/Caskroom/miniconda/base/envs/YOUR_ENVIRONMENT/lib/python3.10/site-packages/')
if package_path not in sys.path:
    sys.path.insert(0, package_path)

import numpy as np
from hstransform import HSTransform

# Create input signal (for example: Voltage signal)
t = np.linspace(0, 10, 100) # timeseries
V_m = 220*np.sqrt(2)  # peak voltage
f_V = 50  # frequency
phi_V = 0  # phase

V_clean = V_m * np.sin(2 * np.pi * f_V * t + phi_V)
# Create voltage sag/dip (80% of the nominal voltage for 0.15 second)
V_sag = np.where((t >= 2) & (t <= 3.5), 0.5 * V_clean, V_clean)

# Create an instance of HSTransform

hs = HSTransform()

# Perform the transform
signal = V_sag
S_transformed = hs.fit_transform(t, signal)
```

### 5.1 Power Quality Disturbance

Compare HS-transform vs. Morlet Wavelet Transform:
![Voltage Disturbance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvlinhvn/HSTransform/main/img/power_quality_disturbance.png)

The figure showed HS-transform is able to detect the transient disturbances like notch, spike. Meanwhile, those signals from Morlet Wavelet transform are not obviously recognized.

######

![Real-Imag Trajectory](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvlinhvn/HSTransform/main/img/power_quality_disturbance_trajectory.png)
We can see also different types of voltage disturbance can generate different real-imaginary trajectory in S-transform at different frequencies.

### 5.2 Power System Faults

![Different Faults](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvlinhvn/HSTransform/main/img/fault_current.png)

As can be seen, both Wavelet and S-transform are able to detect when the fault occur (huge change in current magnitude). Wavelet transform seems more sensitive with noise with high distortion compared with HS-transform.

######

![Real-Imag Trajectory](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvlinhvn/HSTransform/main/img/fault_trajectory.png)

We can also observe different types of faults can generate different real-imaginary trajectory in S-transform at varying levels of frequencies.
